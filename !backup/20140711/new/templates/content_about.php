			<p>I was born June 23, 1983. 23 years later, I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a degree in Graphic Communication and a thirst for good design. I write. I edit. I dance like a fish getting electrocuted. My degree is in Printing but I'm scared to death of desktop printers. I can't sing the blues but I try anyway. I'm a sucker for typography. My cat, Clawed Garamond, is named after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Garamond" title="Claude Garamond, article at Wikipedia">16th century Parisian type designer</a>. That's how geeky I&nbsp;am.</p>

			<p>If you need somebody to fall in love with your project and make it shine, do yourself a favor and get in touch with me. If I can't help you myself, I'm sure I know someone who can.
