<p>As a 26-year-old singer-songwriter living on the Central Coast of California, Kevin Toqe doesn't have to look far to find reflections of God in the surrounding landscape. But it's in the writing and performing landscape that he finds a medium for communicating God's love through every song in his first album, Love Is.</p>

<p>Every album track invites you to listen in on a musical conversation with God, each reflecting on how real life comes rarely as expected but that joy is just as real and possible in every situation.</p>

<p>Kevin's sound and style reflects the musical influences of James Taylor and John Mayer with a twist of Colbie Caillet for good measure, all the while striving to put words and rhythm to the heart of God.</p>

<p>While listening to Love Is, you will find great effort was taken to maintain an authentic, live recording feel, forgoing traditional recording click-tracks and over-compression. This keep-it-simple style focuses on the quality of lyrics while highlighting the talented musicians who keep your foot tapping.</p>

<p>Looking for inviting music that hits you deeply and leaves you thinking? Give Love Is a listen, and you won't be disappointed.</p>

<p>Kevin would like to thank some of the following music influences in his life:</p>

<ul class="thanks">
	<li>Dan Vigus - <em>First band teacher</em></li>
	<li>Steve Muller - <em>Music pastor</em></li>
