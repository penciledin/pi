Dear <?php echo $representative; ?>,

I want you to read the attached article, "The Awakening Giant," and reveal to the public and to your political constituents just how dangerous the logic is. This article was obviously written by a right-wing conservative who is angry about the current administration’s policies and plans for our country’s future. The issues mentioned in this article are all slanted as anti-government and anti-social engineering that will transform our country into one that works well with the rest of the world. It is up to you to read through these issues and do what you can to destroy that twisted mind-set. 

We can no longer support the corrupt capitalists or the marketplace with the TARP or stimulus funds. It should be used to keep extending the unemployment benefits until the rate is at least below 7% again. It should also be used to buy up the foreclosed homes and to subsidize the people who lost them so they can live in them again. The federal government should also make available "English as a Second language," as well as technical skills classes free-of-charge to all unemployed people, so they can learn a new skill that will help them get jobs. We must stop the ranting of right-wing people by silencing their talk-radio pundits, and if necessary, even bailing out the main-stream newspapers and magazines.
 
You must do your part to keep a Democrat majority in Congress and to support President Obama’s policies. He must have the power to make his changes and to be re-elected in 2012. I will support you in your next election if you do.
