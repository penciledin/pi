<h1>We Must Join Together With the Awakened Giant</h1>
<p>I am a patriotic American, a 74-yr.-old 
woman who worked 50 years to avoid Government aid or take-over. I earned 
my living for &gt;30 years as a writer/editor/producer in all the mediums, 
and I am still working as an investigative reporter and activist in 
trying to save our country&#39;s laws and Constitution. </p>
<p>All citizens have the right to demonstrate 
and protest--not just the liberal left who are organized by the Obama 
administration, even though they are the ones who claim that the Republicans 
are being organized and are actually "astro-turf." This first week 
of September 2009, they are sending out 100s of buses across the country 
full of ACORN and SEIU members who they have trained to intimidate, 
protest loudly enough to drown out dissenters, and take over Town Hall 
meetings.</p>
<p>The people who the liberal-left have 
claimed as being "manufactured by the far-right," are people of 
all political parties or even none at all, who have been protesting 
since early this year. They are American citizens who are activists 
for the first times in their lives because they don&#39;t want any more 
bail-outs, stimulus funds, bloated budgets and pork projects. 
If the average citizens are being organized, they are doing it themselves 
through patriotic web sites and community meetings. <br>
</p>
<p>Now Obama and his gang of Czars and ultra-left 
Congress are trying to ram through the Cap and Tax bill, the union Card 
Check, and the nationalized Health Care Reform, no matter how much more 
they raise our debt. They are also trying to take control of communications 
such as radio and the Internet to silence the voices of their dissenters. At 
the same time, they are doing their best to make our Constitution irrelevant. <br>
</p>
<p>We need to return the unspent stimulus 
funds, and lower our debt. We need to lower taxes on small businesses 
so they can start hiring workers again and thus rebuild our capitalist 
marketplace. We need to stop all the give-away programs to those 
too lazy to work, and we need to change welfare to workfare, so that 
people will be motivated enough to attend government classes to learn 
skills that will help them earn more and feel like a worthwhile, productive 
citizen. </p>
<p>This is why people attending these Town 
Hall meetings are sometimes loud and raucous, because their representatives 
are lying to their faces when in person, and are not returning their 
calls, faxes and emails. They think they live in a bubble and only have 
to answer to their constituents and the special interests that helped 
them get elected. However, they have now awakened the sleeping giant, 
and representatives of that giant will be in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 
11-12. We have the voting records of all government representatives, 
and those who are not representing the people--who they are supposed 
to work for--will be voted out in the next election. Also, we 
need to make lobbyists illegal or unconstitutional, so they can no longer 
control our politicians. </p>
<p>In addition, if many more abuses of our 
Constitution take place within the next couple of months, the people 
won&#39;t wait for the elections. They will rise up and demand recalls of 
anyone who they feel are abusing their power, bankrupting our country, 
and trying to turn it into a Socialist regime. They will also demand 
that the corrupt politicians who caused our financial downfall, like 
Paulson, Franklin Raines, Chris Dodd and Barney Frank, be indicted and 
sent to jail. They will also demand refunds from the top politicians 
who were paid off by Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, like Obama, Clinton, 
and the politicians above. They will demand an audit of the FEDERAL 
Reserve, an independent agency. </p>
<p>We need to get rid of all Czars, who 
are unanswerable to the American people or to Congress. We need to reverse 
all of their rulings that were illegal or unethical. We need to abandon 
the Cap and Tax and the Card Check bills. </p>
<p>We need to start over with Health Care 
Reform using a majority (25 members of each party in each Congressional 
house) bi-partisan committee that will vote to deregulate all the government 
bills that are currently stopping insurance companies from being portable 
throughout all states and between jobs. We need to make sure than 
any Health Care reform will subsidize and protect those with pre-existing 
conditions or who are Americans that can't get insurance, but which 
will exclude all abortions and all illegal immigrants and their families. 
We need to deport those immigrants, finish and protect our borders, 
and punish any companies and corporations who hired them. <br>
</p>
<p>We need to stop all frivolous Tort 
lawsuits that just enrich lawyers and then reduce any lawyer fees to 
10% of any settlements--which will also be capped to loss of income 
and quality of life costs. We need to stop relying on foreign 
oil and sending hundreds of billions of dollars to those countries. 
Instead we need to bring our own oil industry up to speed, build nuclear 
reactors, and use natural gas and clean coal when necessary. We need 
to stop spending money on windmills and solar panels until they are 
self-supporting and not dependent on government funding. We can 
forget the scams put forward by Gore and his cronies about Green energy 
until the majority of scientists agree that the problem is man-made 
and we can do something about it. </p>
<p>We need to investigate every part of 
every government agency and rid ourselves of the corruptions, fraud, 
greed, and incompetence. Then we can go back to rewarding productivity, 
patriotism, and good work ethics. That includes schools, law enforcement, 
and every other government employees. We need to stop the schools 
from brainwashing our children into believing the Socialist agenda and 
denying God by getting rid of the teachers and professors that are guilty 
of doing it. If we are going to save this country, we need to bring 
back the God-given morals and values, and bring those to the forefront 
again. </p>
<p>We need to read through the Constitution 
word by word and ensure that our representatives are obeying it in all 
areas, including insisting that Obama release all his records that he 
has currently spent $1M to seal. We need to remove anyone that 
Obama has appointed to his Cabinet that has a criminal record, or even 
anyone who has had ethical violations, such as his current Attorney 
General who got one of our worst tax cheats pardoned by Bill Clinton 
at the last minute. He is also going after anyone in the Bush 
administration and focusing on past activities of the CIA that kept 
our country safe. </p>
<p>Obama and his entire cadre are doing 
everything they can to weaken our country and try to take it over in 
their efforts to make it a One-World government. The people who 
are funding him and pulling his puppet strings, like George Soros and 
the rest of his Communist friends, do not realize how powerful Americans 
can be when they understand what this government is up to. They 
will take back the country, jail all the corrupt politicians that put 
us in the crisis that we are currently in, and get rid of any politician 
who is not willing to join us in our battle to protect America and its 
Constitution. </p>
