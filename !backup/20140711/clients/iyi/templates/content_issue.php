	<h1>Health Care Reform</h1>
	<p>The debate over health care reform in the United States centers on questions about whether there is a fundamental right to health care, on who should have access to health care and under what circumstances, on the quality achieved for the high sums spent, and on the sustainability of expenditures that have been rising faster than the level of general inflation and the growth in the economy. Medical debt is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the United States. The mixed public-private health care system in the United States is the most expensive in the world, with health care costing substantially more per person than in any other nation on Earth. A greater portion of gross domestic product (GDP) is spent on health care in the U.S. than in any United Nations member state except for Tuvalu. A study of international health care spending levels in the year 2000, published in the health policy journal Health Affairs, found that while the U.S. spends more on health care than other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the use of health care services in the U.S. is below the OECD median. The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S.</p>
	<p>According to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the United States is the "only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not ensure that all citizens have coverage". Whether a federal government-mandated system of universal health care should be implemented in the U.S. remains a hotly debated political topic, with Americans divided along party lines in their views regarding whether a new public health plan should be created and administered by the federal government. Those in favor of government-guaranteed universal health care argue that the large number of uninsured Americans creates direct and hidden costs shared by all, and that extending coverage to all would lower costs and improve quality. Opponents of government mandates or programs for universal health care argue that people should be free to opt out of health insurance. Both sides of the political spectrum have also looked to more philosophical arguments, debating whether people have a fundamental right to have health care provided to them by their government.</p>

		<p>We need to return the unspent stimulus 
funds, and lower our debt.  We need to lower taxes on small businesses 
so they can start hiring workers again and thus rebuild our capitalist 
marketplace.  We need to stop all the give-away programs to those 
too lazy to work, and we need to change welfare to workfare, so that 
people will be motivated enough to attend government classes to learn 
skills that will help them earn more and feel like a worthwhile, productive 
citizen. <a href="?page=article&article=1">Read More</a></p></li>

		<p>Let's get a few things straight: Until last year, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's health care bill (co-authored with with Rep. John Dingell) was a bill known as Medicare for All. Not expensive private insurance for some, but Medicare [a public insurance plan] for All.</p></li>
