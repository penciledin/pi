Health Plan</a></h1>
<p>By Roger Hickey, Co-Director of the

<p>Let's get a few things straight: </p>
<ul type="DISC">
 <li>Until last year, <strong>Senator 
 Edward M. Kennedy's</strong> health care bill (co-authored with with Rep. 
 John Dingell) was a bill known as <a href="http://kennedy.senate.gov/newsroom/press_release.cfm?id=B30A5C7B-35AC-4CC9-8192-1B1E50FC8356" target="_blank"><strong>Medicare 
 for All</strong></a>. Not expensive 
 private insurance for some, but <strong>Medicare </strong>
 [a public insurance plan] <strong>for All</strong>. </li>
 <li>Senator Kennedy encouraged 
 candidate and then President Obama to make health care for all his first 
 priority -- during the campaign and as he took office. </li>
 <li>And <strong>Ted Kennedy</strong> remained 
 in charge as his HELP (Health, Education and Labor and Pension) Committee 
 wrote -- and then passed -- <a href="http://help.senate.gov/Maj_press/2009_07_15_b.pdf" target="_blank">a 
 new health care bill with a strong public insurance option</a> for those who want it. </li>
</ul>
<p>I feel the need to remind people 
of all this because conservatives, and especially Republican Senators, 
are trying to promote the idea that if only Ted Kennedy were still actively 
involved in the health care reform effort, he could have gotten the 
Democrats to fold and embrace a weakened "bi-partisan" compromised 
health reform strategy. And some are urging that the best tribute we 
could construct to the great man's memory is to pass such a watered-down 
health bill that could win the support of a large number of conservative 
Republicans. </p>
<p><a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200908260029" target="_blank">Media 
Matters</a> has done 
a good job of tracking and responding to the crocodile tears of Republicans, 
keying off of a <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26443.html" target="_blank">Politico 
obituary</a> that repeats 
the conservative spin that "without Kennedy, Democrats were less willing 
to make the concessions needed for true [health care] compromise." 
But whatever Politico's role, their journalism certainly picked up 
on the boldly outrageous statements of important conservatives. One 
by one, Media Matters' quotes Republicans from Orin Hatch to John 
McCain, lamenting that Kennedy's passing has deprived them all of 
a "reasonable" Democrat who would have won Republican votes by getting 
rid of the public plan or making the cost of "reform" dramatically 
smaller.</p>
<p>Let's get another thing clear: 
 </p>
<p>Republicans don't want a deal. They want to kill health reform.</p>
<p>Democrats, especially a few 
in the Senate Finance committee, have for months been reaching out to 
Republicans with the hand of hopeful bi-partisanship. And in recent 
months, conservative Republicans have made it clear that if Democrats 
(like Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus) are going to continue to reach 
out the hand of compromise, they are ready to bite it off. </p>
<p>As cable television covered 
this weekend's memorials to Ted Kennedy, when the talk got around 
to health care, there was almost always one pundit (usually one without 
much expertise about health care), who could be counted on to repeat 
the conservative talking points: "It will take somebody with a liberal 
reputation like Teddy Kennedy to negotiate a deal with Republicans -- 
and convince the liberals to accept the compromise." </p>
<p>When someone occasionally reminds 
the discussants that even the Finance Committee Republicans, like Grassley 
and Enzi are refusing to make a deal -- as pollster <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/28/AR2009082803169.html" target="_blank">Geoff Garin</a> did in Sunday's <em>Washington Post</em> 
-- one of these all-purpose pundits, like Cokie Roberts, quickly shift 
the arguments from Republicans to conservative Democrats. <em>Newsweek</em>'s <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32493718" target="_blank">Jonathan Alter</a>, who professes to personally support 
single-payer heath care, has regularly gone on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32493718" target="_blank">MSNBC programs</a> to tell liberals they need to give 
up on the public insurance option if they want to get the support of 
enough Democrats to pass health reform without Republican support. The 
generic pundit argument is that liberals need to learn to compromise 
-- by cutting back the total cost of the package and ditching the public 
option in order to get the insurance reforms -- like requiring insurance 
companies to cover all applicants -- and the great step forward of requiring 
everyone to have insurance. </p>
<p>Let's get a few more things 
straight:</p>
<ul type="DISC">
 <li>The public insurance option 
 is consistently <em>very popular</em> in every poll, including the most 
 recent ones, when you ask if people should have the option of choosing 
 a public plan which competes with private insurance companies (which 
 are very <em>un</em>popular). </li>
 <li>The public insurance option 
 is popular even among the supporters of conservative Democrats. </li>
 <li>The House will pass a very 
 progressive health plan -- with a strong public option and enough funding 
 to make health insurance affordable for most Americans. </li>
 <li>Support for a public plan 
 is growing, not shrinking, in the US Senate. Most Democratic Senators, 
 including members of the Finance Committee -- like Baucus (yes, see 
 his White Paper), Bingaman, and two of the strongest supporters of the 
 public option, Rockefeller and Schumer -- have already endorsed a strong 
 public plan. Additional Senators would not vote against it. And Baucus 
 and the rest of the Finance Committee Dems are about to acknowledge 
 the reality that the Republicans have rejected bi-partisanship. That 
 means Democrats can pass a bill like Kennedy's HELP bill. </li>
</ul>
<p>OK, but aren't conservative 
Democrats worried about the high cost of health reform -- and won't 
they demand a smaller, cheaper bill? And won't they oppose a public 
plan?</p>
<p>Let's get a few <em>more</em> 
things straight:</p>
<ul type="DISC">
 <li>Individual mandates are 
 the key demand of the insurance companies. Without that part of the 
 deal, they will fiercely oppose the insurance reforms the pundits say 
 are easy to pass -- the prohibitions against discriminating against 
 people with pre-existing conditions, for example. </li>
 <li>But without subsidies that 
 make insurance policies affordable â€“ for middle class voters as well 
 as the poor -- Democrats (even conservative Democrats) don't want 
 to require their voters to buy health insurance if those policies are 
 not affordable. Without that part of the package likely to disappear 
 if the whole package is cut -- everybody involved in passing health 
 reform will suffer voter backlash. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once fiscally responsible Democrats 
realize they don't want to make large cuts in the size of the program, 
they start to understand that the public insurance option is their best 
tool for keeping the total costs of the program under control. </p>
<p>Blue Dog Democrats in the House 
have already made a deal that accepts a pretty large health reform plan 
-- and a public option. Senate Democrats are coming together around 
a health reform program that is big enough to do the job. And they are 
embracing a public insurance plan that controls costs -- and keeps the 
private insurance industry honest. </p>
<p>In other words, Democrats are 
coming together around the kind of health reform very much like Senator 
Ted Kennedy's HELP bill. </p>
