Dear <?php echo $representative; ?>,
 
The attached article touches on most of the political problems and needed changes in our government. I want you to read them and repeat them to your political constituents, and make them into a bullet list of To-Do projects. Remember, you work for the American citizens. It is time you all realized that and remembered that we can take you out of office as easily as we put you in office.
 
The only things that I would have added to the list would be to (1) put in prison every ACORN and SEIU member that can be convicted of criminal activity, as well as the corrupt politicians who taught them how to do it. (2) Ensure that Obama cannot grant Amnesty to the illegal aliens as a back-door way of giving them medical coverage that he meant them to have all along. (3) Learn and copy the Minnesota changes in TORT reform as an easy way to make it happen, instead of spending time in learning how to do it again. They have already lowered the percentage of frivolous lawsuits by 90 percent and saved billions of dollars in just one year. (4) Withdraw from the U.N. It is time to stop letting them demean us and weaken us. We are the best, strongest country in the world, and if fearing us is the only way to make them realize that, then so be it. (5) Privatize the Native American Reservationsâ€™ health care plan to make sure they have full coverage all year. We also have to privatize Medicare and Medicaid, and get rid of the fraud and corruption as we do it. (6) It is time that we finished protecting our borders with the fences that were promised years ago, and we can add the new technologies invented since then to protect our land/sea borders, and prevent tunnels being built and the possibility of illegals climbing fences. (7) Change the Contracts for retirement and medical benefits for all politicians, from national to local, to match those given to the rest of us American citizens. (After all, we changed the contracts in the auto industry to benefit the unions. We need to change them too.) In other words, politicians get Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the average retirement benefits based on years worked and salary made. No Grandfather clauses. (8) Petition the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
 
Support these plans, and get your cohorts to support them, and we will vote you into office next time.
