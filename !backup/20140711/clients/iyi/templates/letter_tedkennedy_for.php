Dear <?php echo $representative; ?>,
 
We all know that our current medical system must be fixed. Prices are rising many times faster than the rate of inflation in other areas. The necessity of waiting for weeks or months for insurance companies to approve our doctors' requests for expensive tests or treatments is sometimes life-threatening. The hours of waiting time in emergency rooms can also be dangerous, and is exacerbated by the number of illegal aliens who use the emergency rooms in hospitals as their own doctor, since they can't be turned away for lack of money or insurance. I am pleading with you to influence your constituents to join together to stop this log-jam in passing this health-care legislation. Create a plan that can be agreed upon!
 
Part of this plan must be to force our insurance, whether private or public, to cover pre-existing medical conditions and pass-through coverage--between jobs if someone is laid off, as well as to make available policies from every state, so there is more competition between insurance companies. We must also eliminate the possibility of illegal aliens getting this coverage, so they will go back to their home countries. We definitely do not want them to just give them Amnesty and citizenship ahead of those who have applied legally. We must have a full-fledged investigation of all Government-run coverage, plans, including Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance policies on Indian Reservations, who now run out of funds by mid-year. They should be getting enough coverage to cover all Native Americans for the full year every year.
 
If you can help change our messed up medical system to one that works for all American citizens, you can be sure that I will support you in the next election.
